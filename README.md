# JavaScript Bug: Loose Comparison in Length Check

This repository demonstrates a subtle bug in JavaScript related to loose comparison (==) when checking the length of an object.  The original code uses `== null` to check for null or undefined values, which can lead to unexpected results if the input object has a 'length' property that isn't a number or is itself null. 

The `bug.js` file contains the buggy code. The `bugSolution.js` file provides a corrected version using strict equality (===).
